This dashboard link provides my tableau dashboard of data collected from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths as of 6/2/2021. I created tables using queries from 
Micorsoft SQL studios managment! 


Please note, as of 6/6/2021 12:26 PM Chrome at 80% zoom is needed to comfortable view all the data. For one reason or another, Tableau automatic resizing isn't displaing all 
the visualizations correctly on Chrome standard 100% view. This does not effect the statistics.
